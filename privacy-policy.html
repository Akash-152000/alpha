			<p>
				Alpha employs commercially reasonable security methods to prevent unauthorized access to the Platform, to maintain data accuracy and to ensure the correct use of the information Alpha hold.

In the event you withdraw the consent given to us under this Privacy Policy, such withdrawal may hamper your access to the Platform or restrict the provision of our services to you for which Alpha consider that information to be necessary.
						
			</p>

			<b>9. USER'S RIGHTS</b>
			<p>
